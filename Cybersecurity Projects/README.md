# Cybersecurity Projects
These projects were done as part of the UC Davis Networking and Cybersecurity Bootcamp.Below is a description of each project.

The Raven Project -  Ethically hacked an Apache webserver, with Kali Linux in a Hyper-V environment.
Monitored logs from the attack using ELK stack with Kibana.
Used Wireshark to perform Packet Analysis on the network.
Created multiple reports of findings and possible mitigations for hardening the server.

Capstone Engagement - In this project, I took on the role of a red team hacker and blue team offense. 
As the red team, I scanned the network and exploited any WebDAV server vulnerabilities I could find. 
As the blue team, I used Kibana to monitor the traffic I created and came up with ways of mitigating future attacks.

Azure Cloud Security and Bash Scripts - Designed a cloud network with Azure. created and deployed an elk stack to forward logs to kibana. 
Also implemented Security rules to harden the network.
Alongside the cloud network, the GitHub repository also contains Linux scripts I created and ansible scripts used for the cloud network.
